#**Strategic Technology Delivery Leader**

With a 30-year career built on technical rigor and high-stakes operations, I specialize in orchestrating end-to-end technology transformations across global enterprise environments. My approach combines decades of "boots-on-the-ground" engineering with executive-level strategic foresight. I practice human-sourced agility through open-source leadership.

## The Core of My Expertise
Throughout my 12+ years of leadership at **Verizon**, I have acted as a bridge between complex Operations, IT infrastructure, and critical business outcomes. 

**Operational Precision:** Managed multi-million dollar CAPEX/OPEX budgets with 99.9% precision, delivering over $250M in annual savings through intelligent automation.
**Resilient Systems:** Spearheaded Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to maintain 99.72% uptime across global core networks.
**Strategic Innovation:** Championed the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into engineering workflows, driving a 50% increase in AI adoption and shifting operations from reactive to predictive.

### Leadership & Transformation
I am a dedicated practitioner of **Agile** leadership, serving as a primary point of accountability for high-impact Environments. My leadership philosophy is rooted in fostering high-trust, inclusive cultures where global cross-functional teams—from Scrum Masters to Product Owners—are empowered to deliver high-value results.

### Foundational Journey
My career began with a technical foundation in the **U.S. Air Force** (Cable Communications Systems) and evolved through critical technical roles into Major Incident Management for mission-critical financial applications, which propelled me to pursue leadership. This journey culminated in my recent **Master of Science in Strategic Leadership (MSSL)**, which refined my ability to lead organizations through the complexities of both digital and cultural change.
